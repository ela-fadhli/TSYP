## Wazuh Usage

### Monitoring and Alerts

Wazuh continuously monitors your system for potential threats and anomalies by analyzing log data. It generates real-time alerts based on predefined rules, which can be customized to fit your security needs.

- **Access the Wazuh dashboard** by navigating to:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:5601
  ```
  Here, you can view alerts, monitor system status, and configure custom alerting rules.
  
- Wazuh integrates with **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana** for advanced log analysis and visualization.

### Log Collection

Wazuh collects logs from various sources, including operating systems, applications, and network devices. The logs are analyzed using predefined rules to detect suspicious activity.

- **Supported log types**: system logs, firewall logs, application logs, and more.
  
- Logs are stored in the Wazuh manager and can be visualized through the **Kibana** interface.

- **Custom log collection**: Configure Wazuh to collect specific logs by editing the `ossec.conf` file and defining the paths for the logs you want to monitor.

### Wazuh Dashboard Configuration

The Wazuh dashboard is a powerful tool for monitoring and managing security events. Hereâ€™s how to configure it effectively:

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Open your web browser and navigate to the dashboard URL (`http://localhost:5601`).

2. **Initial Setup**: If this is your first time accessing the dashboard, complete the initial setup wizard to connect it to your Wazuh manager and Elasticsearch.

3. **Customize Alerts**:
   - Go to the **Management** tab.
   - Navigate to **Rules** to customize existing rules or add new ones based on your environment's needs.

4. **Dashboards and Visualizations**:
   - Explore predefined dashboards for quick insights.
   - Create custom visualizations using the **Visualize** tab to focus on specific data points relevant to your organization.

5. **User Management**: Set up user roles and permissions under the **Management** section to control access to the dashboard.

## VirusTotal Integration

Cyber Shield integrates **VirusTotal** to enhance the detection of malicious files and URLs. VirusTotal aggregates data from numerous antivirus engines and threat intelligence feeds, allowing you to cross-check suspicious files and links.

### Setup on Ubuntu

To set up VirusTotal on Ubuntu:

1. **Install the VirusTotal API client**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install virustotal-cli
   ```
2. **Configure your API key**:
   Sign up for an API key on the [VirusTotal website](https://www.virustotal.com/), and set it as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```
3. **Use VirusTotal to scan files**:
   ```bash
   vt file scan myfile.txt
   ```

### Setup on Windows

To set up VirusTotal on Windows:

1. **Download and install** the VirusTotal CLI from the [official website](https://www.virustotal.com/).
2. **Set up your API key**:
   ```cmd
   setx VT_API_KEY "your-api-key"
   ```
3. **Run file scans**:
   ```cmd
   vt file scan C:\path\to\file.txt
   ```

## AI Model Configuration

### Supported Attacks

Cyber Shield's AI model is designed to detect and mitigate several types of common cyberattacks. The model is pre-trained to identify patterns associated with the following attack types:

- **SQL Injection**: Detects malicious SQL queries attempting to manipulate databases.
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: Identifies abnormal traffic patterns indicative of DDoS attacks.
- **Brute Force**: Flags multiple failed login attempts that suggest a brute force attack.
- **Ransomware**: Detects file encryption behaviors commonly associated with ransomware.

### Tuning and Customization

The AI model can be tuned to detect additional or specific attack patterns. You can customize its behavior by modifying the configuration files.

1. **Edit the configuration** located in the `config/ai_model.yaml` file to adjust thresholds or add new attack signatures.
   
2. **Retrain the AI model** if necessary:
   - If you've added new attack signatures, retrain the model using the provided dataset or your own custom dataset.

3. **Deploy the updated model** to your Wazuh server for real-time analysis.
