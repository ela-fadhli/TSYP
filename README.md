## VirusTotal Integration

Detecting and removing malware using VirusTotal integration
===========================================================

Wazuh uses the :doc:`integrator </user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/integration>` module to connect to external APIs and alerting tools such as VirusTotal.

In this use case, you use the Wazuh :doc:`File Integrity Monitoring </user-manual/capabilities/file-integrity/index>` (FIM) module to monitor a directory for changes and the VirusTotal API to scan the files in the directory. Then, configure Wazuh to trigger an active response script and remove files that VirusTotal detects as malicious. We test this use case on Ubuntu and Windows endpoints.

You need a `VirusTotal API key <https://developers.virustotal.com/reference/getting-started>`__ in this use case to authenticate Wazuh to the VirusTotal API.

For more information on this integration, check the :doc:`VirusTotal integration </user-manual/capabilities/malware-detection/virus-total-integration>` section of the documentation.


Configuration for the Ubuntu endpoint
-------------------------------------

Configure your environment as follows to test the use case for the Ubuntu endpoint. These steps work for other Linux distributions as well.

Ubuntu endpoint
 

Perform the following steps to configure Wazuh to monitor near real-time changes in the ``/root`` directory of the Ubuntu endpoint. These steps also install the necessary packages and create the active response script that removes malicious files.

 Search for the ``<syscheck>`` block in the Wazuh agent configuration file ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf``. Make sure that ``<disabled>`` is set to ``no``. This enables the Wazuh FIM to monitor for directory changes.

 Add an entry within the ``<syscheck>`` block to configure a directory to be monitored in near real-time. In this case, you are monitoring the ``/root`` directory:



      <directories realtime="yes">/root</directories>

 Install ``jq``, a utility that processes JSON input from the active response script.



      $ sudo apt update
      $ sudo apt -y install jq

 Create the ``/var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh`` active response script to remove malicious files from the endpoint:



      #!/bin/bash

      LOCAL=`dirname $0`;
      cd $LOCAL
      cd ../

      PWD=`pwd`

      read INPUT_JSON
      FILENAME=$(echo $INPUT_JSON | jq -r .parameters.alert.data.virustotal.source.file)
      COMMAND=$(echo $INPUT_JSON | jq -r .command)
      LOG_FILE="${PWD}/../logs/active-responses.log"

      #------------------------ Analyze command -------------------------#
      if [ ${COMMAND} = "add" ]
      then
       # Send control message to execd
       printf '{"version":1,"origin":{"name":"remove-threat","module":"active-response"},"command":"check_keys", "parameters":{"keys":[]}}\n'

       read RESPONSE
       COMMAND2=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r .command)
       if [ ${COMMAND2} != "continue" ]
       then
        echo "`date '+%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S'` $0: $INPUT_JSON Remove threat active response aborted" >> ${LOG_FILE}
        exit 0;
       fi
      fi

      # Removing file
      rm -f $FILENAME
      if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "`date '+%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S'` $0: $INPUT_JSON Successfully removed threat" >> ${LOG_FILE}
      else
       echo "`date '+%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S'` $0: $INPUT_JSON Error removing threat" >> ${LOG_FILE}
      fi

      exit 0;

 Change the ``/var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh`` file ownership, and permissions:



      $ sudo chmod 750 /var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh
      $ sudo chown root:wazuh /var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh

 Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes:



      $ sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent

Wazuh server
 

Perform the following steps on the Wazuh server to alert for changes in the endpoint directory and enable the VirusTotal integration. These steps also enable and trigger the active response script whenever a suspicious file is detected.

 Add the following rules to the ``/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`` file on the Wazuh server. These rules alert about changes in the ``/root`` directory that are detected by FIM scans:



      <group name="syscheck,pci_dss_11.5,nist_800_53_SI.7,">
          <!-- Rules for Linux systems -->
          <rule id="100200" level="7">
              <if_sid>550</if_sid>
              <field name="file">/root</field>
              <description>File modified in /root directory.</description>
          </rule>
          <rule id="100201" level="7">
              <if_sid>554</if_sid>
              <field name="file">/root</field>
              <description>File added to /root directory.</description>
          </rule>
      </group>

 Add the following configuration to the Wazuh server ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file to enable the Virustotal integration. Replace ``<YOUR_VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY>`` with your `VirusTotal API key <https://developers.virustotal.com/reference>`__. This allows to trigger a VirusTotal query whenever any of the rules ``100200`` and ``100201`` are triggered:



      <ossec_config>
        <integration>
          <name>virustotal</name>
          <api_key><YOUR_VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY></api_key> <!-- Replace with your VirusTotal API key -->
          <rule_id>100200,100201</rule_id>
          <alert_format>json</alert_format>
        </integration>
      </ossec_config>

note:

      The free VirusTotal API rate limits requests to four per minute. If you have a premium VirusTotal API key, with a high frequency of queries allowed, you can add more rules besides these two. You can also configure Wazuh to monitor more directories.

 Append the following blocks to the Wazuh server ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file. This enables Active Response and triggers the ``remove-threat.sh`` script when VirusTotal flags a file as malicious:



      <ossec_config>
        <command>
          <name>remove-threat</name>
          <executable>remove-threat.sh</executable>
          <timeout_allowed>no</timeout_allowed>
        </command>

        <active-response>
          <disabled>no</disabled>
          <command>remove-threat</command>
          <location>local</location>
          <rules_id>87105</rules_id>
        </active-response>
      </ossec_config>

 Add the following rules to the Wazuh server ``/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`` file to alert about the Active Response results:



      <group name="virustotal,">
        <rule id="100092" level="12">
          <if_sid>657</if_sid>
          <match>Successfully removed threat</match>
          <description>$(parameters.program) removed threat located at $(parameters.alert.data.virustotal.source.file)</description>
        </rule>

        <rule id="100093" level="12">
          <if_sid>657</if_sid>
          <match>Error removing threat</match>
          <description>Error removing threat located at $(parameters.alert.data.virustotal.source.file)</description>
        </rule>
      </group>

 Restart the Wazuh manager to apply the configuration changes:


      $ sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager

Attack emulation
----------------

 Download an EICAR test file to the ``/root`` directory on the Ubuntu endpoint:



      $ sudo curl -Lo /root/eicar.com https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com && sudo ls -lah /root/eicar.com

Visualize the alerts
--------------------

You can visualize the alert data in the Wazuh dashboard. To do this, go to the **Threat Hunting** module and add the filters in the search bar to query the alerts.

-  Linux - ``rule.id: is one of 553,100092,87105,100201``

   .. thumbnail:: /images/poc/virustotal-remove-malware-linux-alert.png
      :title: Remove malware on Linux alert
      :alt: Remove malware on Linux alert
      :align: center
      :width: 80%

Configuration for the Windows endpoint
--------------------------------------

Windows endpoint
 

Perform the following steps to configure Wazuh to monitor near real-time changes in the ``/Downloads`` directory. These steps also install the necessary packages and create the active response script to remove malicious files.

 Search for the ``<syscheck>`` block in the Wazuh agent ``C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf`` file. Make sure that ``<disabled>`` is set to ``no``. This enables the Wazuh FIM module to monitor for directory changes.

 Add an entry within the ``<syscheck>`` block to configure a directory to be monitored in near real-time. In this use case, you configure Wazuh to monitor the ``C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\Downloads`` directory. Replace the ``<USER_NAME>`` variable with the appropriate user name:



      <directories realtime="yes">C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\Downloads</directories>

 Download the Python executable installer from the `official Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`__.

 Run the Python installer once downloaded. Make sure to check the following boxes:

   -  ``Install launcher for all users``
   -  ``Add Python 3.X to PATH`` (This places the interpreter in the execution path)

 Once Python completes the installation process, open an administrator PowerShell terminal and use ``pip`` to install PyInstaller:



      > pip install pyinstaller
      > pyinstaller --version

   You use Pyinstaller here to convert the active response Python script into an executable application that can run on a Windows endpoint.

 Create an active response script ``remove-threat.py`` to remove a file from the Windows endpoint:

 Convert the active response Python script ``remove-threat.py`` to a Windows executable application. Run the following PowerShell command as an administrator to create the executable:


      > pyinstaller -F \path_to_remove-threat.py

   Take note of the path where ``pyinstaller`` created ``remove-threat.exe``.

 Move the executable file ``remove-threat.exe`` to the ``C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\active-response\bin`` directory.

 Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes. Run the following PowerShell command as an administrator:



      > Restart-Service -Name wazuh

Wazuh server
 

Perform the following steps on the Wazuh server to configure the VirusTotal integration. These steps also enable and trigger the active response script whenever a suspicious file is detected.

 Add the following configuration to the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file on the Wazuh server to enable the VirusTotal integration. Replace ``<YOUR_VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY>`` with your `VirusTotal API key <https://developers.virustotal.com/reference>`__. This allows to trigger a VirusTotal query whenever any of the rules in the FIM ``syscheck`` group are triggered:



      <ossec_config>
        <integration>
          <name>virustotal</name>
          <api_key><YOUR_VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY></api_key> <!-- Replace with your VirusTotal API key -->
          <group>syscheck</group>
          <alert_format>json</alert_format>
        </integration>
      </ossec_config>

note:

      The free VirusTotal API rate limits requests to four per minute. If you have a premium VirusTotal API key, with a high frequency of queries allowed, you can add more rules besides these two. You can configure Wazuh to monitor more directories besides ``C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\Downloads``.

 Append the following blocks to the Wazuh server ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file. This enables Active Response and trigger the ``remove-threat.exe`` executable when the VirusTotal query returns positive matches for threats:



      <ossec_config>
        <command>
          <name>remove-threat</name>
          <executable>remove-threat.exe</executable>
          <timeout_allowed>no</timeout_allowed>
        </command>

        <active-response>

          <rules_id>87105</rules_id>
        </active-response>
      </ossec_config>

 Add the following rules to the Wazuh server ``/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`` file to alert about the Active Response results.


      <group name="virustotal,">
        <rule id="100092" level="12">

          <match>Error removing threat</match>
          <description>Error removing threat located at $(parameters.alert.data.virustotal.source.file)</description>
        </rule>
      </group>

 Restart the Wazuh manager to apply the configuration changes:



      $ sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager

Attack emulation
----------------

 Follow the next steps to temporarily turn off real-time Microsoft Defender antivirus protection in Windows Security:

    Click on the **Start** menu and type ``Windows Security`` to search for that app.
    Select the **Windows Security app** from results, go to **Virus & threat protection**, and under **Virus & threat protection settings** select **Manage settings**.
    Switch **Real-time protection** to **Off**.

 Download an `EICAR test <https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt>`__ file to the ``C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\Downloads`` directory on the Windows endpoint.


      > Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt -OutFile eicar.txt
      > cp .\eicar.txt C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\Downloads

   This triggers a VirusTotal query and generates an alert. In addition, the active response script automatically removes the file.

## AI Model Configuration

### Supported Attacks

Cyber Shield's AI model is designed to detect and mitigate several types of common cyberattacks. The model is pre-trained to identify patterns associated with the following attack types:

- **SQL Injection**: Detects malicious SQL queries attempting to manipulate databases.
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: Identifies abnormal traffic patterns indicative of DDoS attacks.
- **Brute Force**: Flags multiple failed login attempts that suggest a brute force attack.
- **Ransomware**: Detects file encryption behaviors commonly associated with ransomware.

### Tuning and Customization

The AI model can be tuned to detect additional or specific attack patterns. You can customize its behavior by modifying the configuration files.

1. **Edit the configuration** located in the `config/ai_model.yaml` file to adjust thresholds or add new attack signatures.
   
2. **Retrain the AI model** if necessary:
   - If you've added new attack signatures, retrain the model using the provided dataset or your own custom dataset.

3. **Deploy the updated model** to your Wazuh server for real-time analysis.
